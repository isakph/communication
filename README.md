# communication
Defining and modelling communication in various ways. 

To begin with, I would quite simply like to learn how to model simple social systems, such as social networks with agent-based modelling. 
Later on, a desideratum is to model advanced things like Niklas Luhmann's conception of social systems, and so on, possibly by making the agents [anticipatory](https://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/8/2/7.html). 
We will see, though. 

Since the law is a social system according to this view, I will also look into how I can simulate legal interactions and the like. 

For now though, this is some stuff that I did to test my concentration for short periods of time while on sick leave with a concussion ...
bloody concussions ...

## Future Ideas
- Implement a form of [information uncertainty](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-00550-001)
- [Let LLMs infer symbolic cognitive models of human behaviour](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.05.636732v1) and use these models in an anticipatory system *vel sim.*
